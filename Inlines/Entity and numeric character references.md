### Entity and numeric character references

Valid HTML entity references and numeric character references
can be used in place of the corresponding Unicode character,
with the following exceptions:

- Entity and character references are not recognized in code
  blocks and code spans.

- Entity and character references cannot stand in place of
  special characters that define structural elements in
  CommonMark.  For example, although `&#42;` can be used
  in place of a literal `*` character, `&#42;` cannot replace
  `*` in emphasis delimiters, bullet list markers, or thematic
  breaks.

Conforming CommonMark parsers need not store information about
whether a particular character was represented in the source
using a Unicode character or an entity reference.

[Entity references](https://github.github.com/gfm/#entity-references) consist of `&` + any of the valid HTML5 entity names + `;`. The document [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/entities.json](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/entities.json) is used as an authoritative source for the valid entity references and their corresponding code points.  
[Example 314](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-314)  

    &nbsp; &amp; &copy; &AElig; &Dcaron;
    &frac34; &HilbertSpace; &DifferentialD;
    &ClockwiseContourIntegral; &ngE;

   

    <p>  &amp; © Æ Ď
    ¾ ℋ ⅆ
    ∲ ≧̸</p>

[Decimal numeric character](https://github.github.com/gfm/#decimal-numeric-character) consist of `&#` + a string of 1–7 arabic digits + `;`. A numeric character reference is parsed as the corresponding Unicode character. Invalid Unicode code points will be replaced by the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (`U+FFFD`). For security reasons, the code point `U+0000` will also be replaced by `U+FFFD`.  
[Example 315](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-315)  

    &#35; &#1234; &#992; &#0;

   

    <p># Ӓ Ϡ �</p>

[Hexadecimal numeric character](https://github.github.com/gfm/#hexadecimal-numeric-character) consist of `&#` + either `X` or `x` + a string of 1-6 hexadecimal digits + `;`. They too are parsed as the corresponding Unicode character (this time specified with a hexadecimal numeral instead of decimal).  
[Example 316](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-316)  

    &#X22; &#XD06; &#xcab;

   

    <p>&quot; ആ ಫ</p>

Here are some nonentities:  
[Example 317](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-317)  

    &nbsp &x; &#; &#x;
    &#987654321;
    &#abcdef0;
    &ThisIsNotDefined; &hi?;

   

    <p>&amp;nbsp &amp;x; &amp;#; &amp;#x;
    &amp;#987654321;
    &amp;#abcdef0;
    &amp;ThisIsNotDefined; &amp;hi?;</p>

Although HTML5 does accept some entity references without a trailing semicolon (such as `&copy`), these are not recognized here, because it makes the grammar too ambiguous:  
[Example 318](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-318)  

    &copy

   

    <p>&amp;copy</p>

Strings that are not on the list of HTML5 named entities are not recognized as entity references either:  
[Example 319](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-319)  

    &MadeUpEntity;

   

    <p>&amp;MadeUpEntity;</p>

Entity and numeric character references are recognized in any context besides code spans or code blocks, including URLs, [link titles](https://github.github.com/gfm/#link-title), and [fenced code block](https://github.github.com/gfm/#fenced-code-block) [info strings](https://github.github.com/gfm/#info-string):  
[Example 320](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-320)  

    <a href="&ouml;&ouml;.html">

   

    <a href="&ouml;&ouml;.html">

[Example 321](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-321)  

    [foo](/f&ouml;&ouml; "f&ouml;&ouml;")

   

    <p><a href="/f%C3%B6%C3%B6" title="föö">foo</a></p>

[Example 322](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-322)  

    [foo]
    
    [foo]: /f&ouml;&ouml; "f&ouml;&ouml;"

   

    <p><a href="/f%C3%B6%C3%B6" title="föö">foo</a></p>

[Example 323](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-323)  

    ``` f&ouml;&ouml;
    foo
    ```

   

    <pre><code class="language-föö">foo
    </code></pre>

Entity and numeric character references are treated as literal text in code spans and code blocks:  
[Example 324](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-324)  

    `f&ouml;&ouml;`

   

    <p><code>f&amp;ouml;&amp;ouml;</code></p>

[Example 325](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-325)  

        f&ouml;f&ouml;

   

    <pre><code>f&amp;ouml;f&amp;ouml;
    </code></pre>


Entity and numeric character references cannot be used
in place of symbols indicating structure in CommonMark
documents.
